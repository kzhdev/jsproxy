#JsProxy
============

Creates a JavaScript interface for a dart project so that a dart library can be easily used from JavaScript world.

**[Experimental]** It is at a very early stage today. The user needs to specify a conversion function to expose dart
library (Please see test.dart as an example). The goal of this project is to provide an annotation and an transformer 
which auto generate a javascript interface for a dart library.
